============================

This is a list of random bits and pieces I'll be working on for
LiCe5 in the future. 
Feel free to email me, tim@muppetz.com with any thing else you'd like to see!

* Remove all compatability stuff in lice.epic5, or at least use only what we need.
  I have started on this. Moving to serverctl and windowctl...

* Update /ctog to support server+channel instead of just channel. [Hard]
* Fix broken /adcc - Nearly. - DONE(?)
* Update /noig to not display /ctog Q channels. [DONE - Displays a notice instead though]
* Make autocompelte work for HELP
* Add NOTE into dbmctl
[DONE] Use epic's built in log function, rather than the chanlog ^ON method?
* Rebuild the themes...
* Accept LiCe is legacy and call it a day...
