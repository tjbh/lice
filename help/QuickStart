                        <<< LiCe QuickStart Guide >>>

This guide will help you quickly get started using the LiCe script for
EPIC.

                               - Settings -
LiCe has a number of commands to change the settings in use.  
Each command will bring up a menu with a short explaination of what
they do. You can change more than one setting at once.

If you have used previous versions of LiCe, you'll be used to having
to /SAVE settings. /SAVE is no longer required in LiCe 5.2.0, all
settings are now written to the LiCe save database automatically.

  3/SENSORS - Change LiCe sensor settings.  Unless you understand what
             you're doing, it's only recommended to change the AutoNick
             and the AutoAWAY settings.

  3/TOG     - Change main LiCe toggles.  Most users these days prefer to
             turn off Flood Protection, which is on by default.
             Also note that automatically checking for updates is on by
             default. This connects to the LiCe webserver when you load
             LiCe so you may wish to turn this off.
             Your main toggles are show on the status bar (if you're 
             using the default theme)

  3/MTOG    - Change settings relating to messaging in LiCe.  Setting 
             save to disk is recommended to ensure if your client crashes
             or disconnects you won't lose your messages.

  3/WTOG    - Change settings relating to windows in LiCe.  Windows are
             an advanced topic.  Setting global status titlebar will show
             the topic of each channel at the top of the screen which
             many users find useful.

  3/DTOG    - Settings relating to DCC file transfers.

  3/CTOG	- Change the toggles for the channel you're currently on.

                                - Messages -
LiCe will log message when you're set away, as long as /MTOG U is enabled.

  4/GONE    - This will set you away on the server.  If you don't specify a
             message after the command, LiCe will use a random message from
             the gone.reasons file.

  4/BACK    - This will set you as back on the server. You can specify a
             message to tell people why you're back.

  4/PLAY    - This will show you all messages logged while you were away.
             It has a small built in menu to help you use it.

  4/ERASE   - Delete all messages from your away log.

                             - Useful Commands -
List of commands that will be helpful.

  5/J       - Join command. Used to join a channel, i.e. /J #LiCe

  5/L       - Leave command. Used to leave the channel you're on.

  5/AR      - Set a word (or words) that will be highlighted when said in a
             channel you're in. Makes it easy to see your nickname when
             in a busy channel and also will log any mention of it when you
             are set away.

  5/THEME   - Change the appearance of LiCe!  There are many different themes
             to choose from.

  5/NOIG    - You can use this command to remove any ignores that are
             currently active.

  5/SC      - List all the nicks on the current channel.

  5/WHOIS   - Will perform a whois on the nickname requested.
	     i.e. /WHOIS tjh

  5/QUIT    - Quit epic5 and resume your normal boring life!
