	- Don't display bootup logo if environment variable 
	  IRCNOLOGO is set to 1
	- No longer set LOAD_PATH in lice.defaults. It's not
	  necessary. Set it in .epicrc if you need to modify it

	  heaps of topic changes you'll have to manually ignore

	- Code optimisations to database and main routines.
	- Removed dead and commented out code.
	- Added /ACCEPT to manage the CallerID (UMODE +g) list

	  running LiCe.
	- Ensure no away time information is sent when /TOG Q is set
	- New /MTOG X to disable logging that you were set AutoAWAY

	  by brandon
	- Lots of help file updates and additions of missing commands.

*** Changes in version 5.2.7 - 07/15/15
	- We now use epic's built in logging function instead of many ON's for
	  the chanlog feature. Log file formats have changed slightly because
	  of this. Timestamp used is /SENS S value.
	- Moved pre-5.1.0 changes to extra/changelog.legacy
	- Fixed bug where auto-away could send messages to channels if you
	  were connected to multiple servers.
	- Auto-away now notifies what servers you were set away on.
	- There will now only be one entry in your away log when you are 
	  automatically set away on multiple servers at the same time.
	- Added Esc-\ to update lag indicator.
	- Fixed (really!) the order servers are loaded/saved in so it's
	  always consistant.
	- Optimised auto-away routine & fixed bug where you wouldn't get set
	  away automatically on servers if you were already away on one.
	- More optimisations to database routines.
	- Flood routine and self protect [esc-`] will now use the server side
	  CallerID feature, if your server supports it. (usermode +g)
	- Reverted /noig to use original LiCe4 code and formatting, updated 
	  default ignore types to match LiCe4's
	- Fixed issue where /MTOG H would change the case of the text to match
	  the auto-reply case. This broke URL's that contained the auto-reply
	  string, if the URL's case was different. Reported by z2e
	- Fixed /NOIG * not removing entries from the database.
	- /NOIG now highlights ignores set by /CTOG Q
	- EPIC5-1.1.11 now minimum recommended version.

*** Changes in version 5.2.6 - 04/11/14
	- Made window creation faster
	- Fix for compatibility with EPIC5-1.1.8+

*** Changes in version 5.2.5 - 04/01/13
	- Improved handling of /CTOG when you're not in a channel.
	- /CTOG now works with channel names like '##freebsd'.
	- Fixed a typo that stopped /DHOP for working.
	- Tiny fix for the status bar not being drawn correctly on restart 
	  of client.
	- Added AUTO_RECONNECT functionality from 'epic5/script/reconnect'.
	- Small fix to /HELP. It will no longer leave your PWD in the wrong
	  place. This was causing console window managers like tmux to open new 
	  windows in LiCe's help directory regardless of where EPIC was started.
	- Fixed bug with /CTOG Q not being removed from the database. This
	  caused the channel to be ignored again on restart.
	- Restored /CTOG Q to ignore the same types that LiCe has historically
	  ignored.
	- Added "Security" line to whois format in "echoes" theme.
	- Any binds that temporarily put information in your status bar (like
	  ^Wu for client uptime) would overwrite the correct STATUS_FORMAT if
	   double line status bars were not used. This has been fixed.
	- Fixed /NOIG formatting when timestamps are enabled.
	- Fixed /PPL formatting when timestamps are enabled.
	- Fixed /CTOG T stripping all your channel sets if you entered nothing
	  in the prompt.
	- /HELP, /NOIG, /PPL, /THEME, /PIC, netsplit list, and the tab 
	  completion list now format correctly with any length of timestamp
	  format set by /SENSORS S. 
	- KICK flood detection is now handled exclusively by the ON FLOOD hook
	  which respects /CTOG O & /CTOG V. Thanks Sebek for reporting this.
	- Fixed masks used by flood protection when banning or adding to 
	  shitlist.
	- Removed /CTOG 2 (banning cycle dorks). JOIN/PART floods are still
	  handled by LiCe's standard flood protection.

*** Changes in version 5.2.4 - 08/14/12
	- Fixed issue with /TOG Q, LiCe information was still being
	  returned if you were CTCP VERSION'd. Thanks whitefang for
	  reporting.
	- /SENS S now accepts spaces. Reported by Q.
	- Fixed bug with /HELP reported by whitefang.
	- Documentation cleanups and fixes.
	- You can disable the channel cache sync check 
	  by setting /SENS C to 0.  This has been a problem for some
	  users joining and then parting channels, though the ideal
	  fix is to set the /SENS C to a higher figure (say, 30)

*** Changes in version 5.2.3 - 05/18/12
	- Optimised restoring the database on LiCe load - Much faster.
	- Fixed database routine to ensure only valid data is written
	  to database when using /SET
	- Updated /CHANST to support halfop.
	- Lots of help file documentation updates.
	- Fixed some ^W binds not working if using a single status
	  line.
	- /MSAY and /MME now support sending to all channels on all 
	  connected servers.
	- Fixed problems with /NOTE not working correctly.
	- Fixed /PAGER
	- Added lice.database to extra directory. You can view/edit
	  your LiCe 5.2.0+ database using this script.

*** Changes in version 5.2.2 - LiCe HalfOP Release! - 05/12/12
	- Added support for the display of halfop status on join and to
	  SC, CWHO, PPL and MASS.
	- Added /HOP and /DHOP plus documentation.
	- Updated most themes to support +h count in /SC footer.
	- Corrected theme bug causing some functions being called twice.
	- You can now install *.reason files in your .lice directory.
	  If they're found, they will be used instead of the supplied 
	  ones in the lice install directory. Useful for global
	  installs, allows each user to customise their gone/back/quit
	  etc reason files individually.
	- Fixed bug where /UPDATE would still trigger even if the
	  disable_update file existed.  Thanks Q for reporting.
	- Fixes to many themes to fix blank lines on /WHOIS & /WHOWAS
	  Reported by Q
	- Bug fixes to /SILENCE & added documentation for SILENCE to
	  the user help.
	- Fixed /GONE -a not setting a message.
	- Enhanced /BACK to support -a, returning you to all connected
	  servers.
	- /HELP no longer cares about case.
	
*** Changes in version 5.2.1 - 04/30/12
	- Fixed cleanup routines not being called when leaving a channel.
	- Updates to QuickStart guide and other help files.
	- We now instantly remove servers from database when deleted.
	- Small fix to /CTOG when not on a channel.
	
*** Changes in version 5.2.0 - 04/25/12
	- *MAJOR* changes have been made to LiCe!  Please read these
	  notes carefully.
	- /SAVE is no longer required. All settings are written to
	  a database now in realtime.  By default this is ~/.lice but
	  you can override this with the IRCSAVE environment variable.
	- LiCe can be installed anywhere now. No longer is .irc used,
	  this means that old settings _will not_ be migrated. Sorry!
	  This also supports system-wide installs, please see GLOBAL
	  in the help directory for more information.
	- Added QUITS and removed CTCPs from /CTOG Q
	- Fixed the friend !UNBAN command.  A side-effect is that /sb
	  no longer shows "extra" info. Use the -f flag to see details.
	- Fixed /TOG X when used on multiple servers.
	- Fixed /PPL to accept a channel argument as detailed in the
	  help file.
	- Fixed /PPL breaking /WHO for the current chan.
	- Servers are now saved correctly (and automatically)
	- Other small fixes for reported issues.
	- CTOG Q no longer quiets topic changes. Doing so breaks topic
	  update notifications!
	- Fixed /WTOG T to properly show topics with double quotes in them.
	- Fixed names display if /MTOG V isn't turned on.
	- This release will probably have bugs! Please report them!

*** Changes in version 5.1.2
	- Fixed stupid bug if you enabled/disabled /MTOG E

*** Changes in version 5.1.1
	- If /MTOG E is enabled, messages are written to disk in encoded
	  format. This IS NOT encypted and is *simple* to decode. It
	  only stops casual glances or text searches.
	- Heavily optimised MTOG E disk writes and initial messages load.
	  This changes the save format. If you see oddness just /ERASE
	- Couple of small changes that HSOC noted. Thanks, HSOC.
	- Fixed mistakes in armitage theme. Reported by cripy_
	- Added getting started help guide. /HELP QuickStart

*** Changes in version 5.1.0
	- Dropped the m from the version. No one else is developing LiCe,
	  this is as official as it gets.
	- Update fixed! /UPDATE downloads files and gives you any important
	  messages. This was all SrfRoG's work. I've just enhanced it a bit.
	- Fixed operview/messageview windows not showing reverse status
	  lines.
	- Removed sping.gz from help/user, updated symlink & alias for
	  the /RLAG command.
	- Added input prompt to bitchx theme.
	- Improved the wget routine to ensure that a fresh copy is always
	  requested. This means if you're behind a cache you won't get stale
	  news when you /UPDATE
	- Fixed problem where you got two messages logged in away log on
	  public flood.
	- Fixed mask used on public flood. No longer as insane.
	- Implemented /MTOG E. When on, anything in your away log is also
	  written to disk. This protects you against client crash/kill.
	  As soon as you disable it the log file is deleted.  When you
	  enable it, any messages in the away log are saved to it.
